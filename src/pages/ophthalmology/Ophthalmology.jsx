            At Berton Clinical, our comprehensive expertise in ophthalmology
            spans the entire spectrum of clinical research, from Phase I through
            Phase IV trials, encompassing a wide range of eye diseases and
            conditions. Our tailored approach to ophthalmic research allows us
            to address the unique challenges and complexities associated with
            each study phase and indication.

          <h5>Our Ophthalmology Capabilities Extend To The Following Areas:</h5>
          <p>
            <b>Retinal Diseases:</b> Our expertise includes the evaluation of
            treatments for both wet and dry age-related macular degeneration
            (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and other
            retinal disorders. We collaborate with renowned retinal specialists
            to conduct studies aimed at advancing therapeutic options for these
            sight-threatening conditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Glaucoma:</b> We conduct clinical trials focused on the
            management and treatment of glaucoma, a leading cause of
            irreversible blindness worldwide. Our studies explore novel
            interventions aimed at preserving vision and reducing intraocular
            pressure in patients with glaucoma.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Infectious and Inflammatory Eye Diseases:</b> Berton Clinical is
            at the forefront of research into treatments for infectious and
            inflammatory eye diseases, including uveitis, conjunctivitis, and
            keratitis. We work closely with leading experts in ocular immunology
            to evaluate the safety and efficacy of new therapeutic approaches in
            these conditions
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Ocular Injuries/Trauma:</b> Our research efforts also extend to
            the field of ocular injuries and trauma, where we evaluate
            interventions aimed at promoting wound healing, reducing
            inflammation, and preserving vision following ocular trauma.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> Eye Surgery and Treatment Medical Devices:</b> We collaborate
            with device manufacturers and surgical experts to conduct studies
            evaluating the safety and efficacy of innovative ophthalmic surgical
            techniques and medical devices. These studies encompass a wide range
            of interventions, including intraocular lenses, corneal implants,
            and surgical instrumentation.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Our extensive network of investigational sites includes leading
            academic ophthalmology research centers, private practices,
            hospital-based clinics, and retina specialists with expertise in
            clinical trials. These sites are led by experienced principal
            investigators who specialize in various ophthalmology subspecialties
            and have access to diverse patient populations ideal for meeting
            study criteria.
